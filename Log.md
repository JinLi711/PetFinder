This is the log of all the progress made on the PetFinder project. Hope everything goes well!

**Today's Progress**

1. Started up by downloading the data and creating starter files.

2. Created steps in my [Plan.md](https://github.com/JinLi711/PetFinder/blob/master/Plan.md) Completed some objectives (as described in Plan.md). Tried to understand the features and the categories (or numbers) in each feature.

**Thoughts** Although the images and text have been ran through Google Cloud's API, I think it would be interesting to build my own neural networks to do this analysis (since Google Cloud's API is for a general analysis)

Decided its probably more efficient to describe my thoughts in this log, since I describe what I accomplished in Plan.md.

**Thoughts** Definitely going to do my own analysis on pictures and text since GCP results aren't that informative.

**What I Could Have Done Better** 

  * Instead of visualizing through Python notebooks, visualize it through a framework like flask.
  * How do I unittest visualizations?
  * Create classes even before creating visualizations.
  * Are there better places to put my observations other than in the python notebooks?
